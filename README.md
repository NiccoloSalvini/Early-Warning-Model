# Early-Warning-Model
interactive dashboard that displays Probability of Default wake-up-calls
------
This **Dashboard** is an `in-itinere` project to evaluate the **Risk** associated to some financial indexes fluctuation.
The original tool was pretty confusing and developed in Excel by Ordine dei Commercialisti di Milano, so
my goal is to make it clear and have some statistical significance.

 This tool defines a **mere decision support** and does not constitute in any case,
 whether it is independent or professional, of the control's body designated, whom 
 final statement **can be widely different** from the model results.
